 \textbf{[CMH: Vince or Megan, please elaborate. I'm looking for terse, citable facts about suicide]} Suicide is epidemic in some populations. It is the th leading cause of death. In nearly all populations, it is on the rise.

\textbf{[CMH: Vince or Megan, I'm making a lot of claims about clinical practice complete ad hoc. Please rewrite as necessary.]} From a clinical perspective, suicide is a social-behavioral problem one that is related to other social-behavioral problems, such as depression or drug addiction. Unfortunately, due to a number of reasons, including social stigma, individuals afflicted with such pre-suicidal conditions can often not be replied upon to report their behavior.  Suicidal behavior is usually not discovered until the victim acts, and even then diagnosis is muddy. 

Suicide is extremely infrequent and usually the result of psychological distress that takes several weeks at the very least to manifest. How can social media and its primary virtues, namely high sample rates and volume [maybe a reference here to that Alex Pentland diagram, Vince?], help to detect suicidality? Certainly, one would expect that within the sheer volume of data that the most popular social media services produce must lie some evidence of suicide ideation. Suicidal behavior, however, is extremely difficult to diagnose even in the best of situations. Rather than pick out obvious rare cases, our goal here is to detect in the language of microblog users expressions 
of behavior or ideas related to suicide. Most of this language will, of course, not indicate actual suicide ideation... [something about painting a picture of how factors related to suicide lie in a virtual social space.]

In contrast to the way that suicide is detecting in clinical settings [Megan, hopefully you will say something about this in the clinical subsection above], the high sample rates that social media provide allow us to detect clues of suicide-related behavior as they occur, without relying on self reporting by often highly unreliable sources.

\section{Introduction}

Suicide is among the top ten leading causes of death in the United States, and when the age range is narrowed to include individuals 10-44 years in age, suicide is among the top five causes of death \cite{heron2009deaths}. Indeed, while mortality rates for most illnesses decreased between 2008 and 2009, the rate of suicide increased by 2.4\%  \cite{heron2009deaths}, and research suggests that the lifetime prevalence for suicidal ideation is between 5.6 and 14.3 percent, with an even greater prevalence among youth (19.8–24.0\%) \cite{nock2008suicide}. Approximately, one third of individuals who reported lifetime suicidal ideation made a plan and nearly three-quarters of those who reported having a suicide plan went on to attempt suicide \cite{kessler1999prevalence}. According to Kessler, Borges, and Walters  \cite{kessler1999prevalence}, the odds of attempting suicide increased exponentially when individuals endorsed three of more risk factors (e.g., having a mood or substance abused disorder).
	Although additional knowledge about risk factors for suicidal behaviors (i.e., suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has clinical implications; traditional methods for researching suicidal behavior is influenced by sociocultural barriers such as stigma and shame as well as issues with methodology \cite{crosby2011self}. For instance, data is often collected from healthcare organizations or large-scale studies that are often limited depending on providers’ ability to assess and document suicide risk or from self-report measures \cite{crosby2011self,horowitz2009suicide}. However, computational linguistics methods informed by surveillance techniques as well as a theoretical model of suicidal behavior may provide additional insight into this significant public health concern. Especially since individuals may be more inclined to seek out support from informal resources such as social media networks instead of seeking treatment \cite{crosby2011self,bruffaerts2011treatment,ryan2010universal}. Evidence suggests that youth and emerging adults usually prefer to seek help from their friends and families; however, higher levels of suicidal ideation had an inverse relationship with all types of help-seeking and a positive correlation with the decision to not seek support \cite{deane2001suicidal}.   
	Aside from demographic variables, previous suicide attempts, mental health concerns (i.e., depression, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and impulsivity), family history of suicide, interpersonal conflicts (i.e., family violence and bullying), mechanism or means for suicidal behavior (e.g., firearms)  are commonly cited risk factors for suicidal behavior \cite{nock2008suicide,crosby2011self,gaynes2004screening,harriss2005suicidal,shaffer2004columbia,shaffer2004columbia,brown2000risk}. Suicide is a complex phenomenon with a low base-rate; therefore, many researchers tend to focus on examining the relationship between risk factors and suicidal behavior without relying heavily on theoretical models \cite{nock2008suicide} .  However, Mann, Waternaux, Haas, and Malone \cite{mann1999toward}, developed the stress-diathesis model for suicidal behavior using many of the aforementioned risk factors. Specifically, this framework suggests that objective states such as depression and life events as well as subjective states and traits such as a family history of depression and/or suicide as well as substance abuse were among the risk factors that contributed to suicidal ideation and could eventually lead to either externalizing (e.g., interpersonal violence) or internalizing aggression (e.g., attempting suicide) \cite{mann1999toward}.
	Since the stress-diathesis model was developed using risk factors for suicidal behavior, it is the ideal framework to analyze publically available linguistic data from social media outlets such as Twitter. While traditional methods are limited by survey questions or clinical reports, data from social media can be used as a natural experiment to examine depression and suicidal ideation without being constrained by such sample biases as individuals who are willing take part in research and/or seek out formal sources of support. Moreover, this natural experiment method may provide information about individuals who are unlikely to engage in formal help-seeking behaviors and eventually it could be used to identify effective methods in natural helping. Hence, this universal approach to screening for suicidal behaviors may have future implications not only for identifying individuals who have a higher prevalence for suicidal behaviors but it could eventually lead to the methods for enhancing protective factors against suicide.  
 

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{description}
\item[R1] Using support vector machines trained on primarily linguistic features, can we learn to classify tweets as whether or not they express ideas related to suicide?
\item[R2] Can network structure enhance such classification models?
\item[R3] Can we predict the expression of suicide-related ideas in the future?

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Overview}
\textbf{CMH: Mention coding as the method of obtaining ground truth; provide justification for it.}
\subsection{Data}
Twitter is a worldwide popular social networking and microblogging service. Twitter message contains up to 140 words each and such words limit encourages users to update frequently. User's regular posts on Twitter have been used to predict depression[Munmun De Choudhury et al., 2013], influenza-like illnesses[Adam Sadilek et al., 2012] in previous studies. Our research looked into an old Twitter dataset originated from the New York City, which covered a month long period since May 18, 2010, total with about 2.5 million tweets from 6,237 unique users. See Table~\ref{table::dataset}.

Among these, terms in Sad category were generated from LIWC [http://www.liwc.net/index.php]. All the rest were concluded from depression and other psychological disorders (Lewinsohn, Rohde, \& Seely, 1994), prior suicide attempts (Lewinsohn et al., 1994), family violence, family history of drug abuse, firearms in the home, and exposure to the suicidal behavior of others (National Insti- tute of Mental Health, 2012). Other search terms included common antidepressants, as well as phrases that indicated suicide (Hawton, Zahl, \& Weaterall, 2003), ideation (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2012a), deliberate self-harm (Zahl \& Hawton, 2004), bullying (Klomek, Sourander, \& Gould, 2011), feelings of isolation (CDC, 2012), and impulsiveness (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2012b). [Self-directed Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, report from Megan]

Before searching, we did some kinds of preprocess work:  (1) converted all text to lower case (2) stripped out all the punctuations and special characters; (3) built a slang dictionary which contains 5424 text slang based on online resources [http://www.noslang.com/dictionary/], Internet slang, and abbreviations. We replaced all the matching items fount in the dataset with corresponding easy read words. These two steps helped us extract more suicide-related tweets for analysis in the following process.


\subsection{Preprocess}
-stopwords
-keep stemming words

Using Scikit-learn package(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html\#citing-scikit-learn), it is very simple to remove stop words (like ``and'', ``the'', etc.) with parameter ``stop\_words'' tuned as ``string \{`english'\}''. 

At the same time, we kept original words without any word stemming, i.e.: ``computers'', ``computing'', and ``compute'', neither of these words will be mapped to the same stem ``comput''. The reason here is: a tweet containing like ``soooooooooo sad!" is supposed to convey stronger emotions than simple ``so sad''.

\subsection{Analysis}
-topic modeling \cite{Blei}

\subsection{features}
-unigram, bigram, trigram
-tf-idf
As features, we used unigram, bigram and trigram tokens in the whole training data as the attributes. For example, a simple tweet ``I am so depressed'' is represented as the following feature vector: \{I, am, so, depressed, I am, am so, so depressed, I am so, am so depressed\}. The tf-idf values were calculated for each attribute: tf-idf stands for ``term frequency - inverse document frequency'', which is a numerical statistic to reflect how important a tokenization is to a document in a collection or corpus. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a tokenization appears in the dataset, but is offset by the frequency of the tokenization in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words are generally more common than others. With the help of Scikit-learn package(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html\#citing-scikit-learn), there values can be easily acquired.

\subsection{Network Features}
One of the fundamental properties of social networks appears to be \emph{tie strength}, or how ``close'' socially two people are. A large body of literature suggests that people are more likely to share personal information with stronger ties, and that weak ties play an important role in providing new information.  
Measuring tie strength is problematic, as there is no gold standard here. Social networking services seem to exacerbate the disparity between strong and weak ties, as many have ``friends'' or ``followers'' whom they may not even know personally, and also create their own problems and opportunities for estimating tie strength. In large-scale network analysis, researchers have sometimes characterized tie strength by the 
\emph{embeddedness} of an edge, which is the number of friends in common that two actors sharing a tie have. Highly embedded links are part of a strong social fabric, and represent strong ties. Another method of estimating tie strength is to measure the amount of activity between users. In this study, we investigate both the role that embeddness and activity play in corrolating suicide-related language. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Strength of Ties}
Table~\ref{tab:strength} shows how the use of sad language (measure by the LIWC sad feature) correlates among users sharing different tie strength and between personal and broadcast messages.
