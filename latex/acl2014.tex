\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Data}
Twitter is a worldwide popular social networking and microblogging service. Twitter message contains up to 140 words each and such words limit encourages users to update frequently. User's regular posts on Twitter have been used to predict depression[Munmun De Choudhury et al., 2013], influenza-like illnesses[Adam Sadilek et al., 2012] in previous studies. Our research looked into an old Twitter dataset originated from the New York City, which covered a month long period since May 18, 2010, total with about 2.3 million tweets from XXXX unique users. (any other basic information of our dataset?)

\subsection{Data Collection}
-slang replace
-strip punctuations

To identify suspected suicide tweets, we created a list of inclusive search terms/phrases according to various risk factors and warning signs linked to suicide. [Table 1]

Among these, terms in Sad category were generated from LIWC [http://www.liwc.net/index.php]. All the rest were concluded from depression and other psychological disorders (Lewinsohn, Rohde, \& Seely, 1994), prior suicide attempts (Lewinsohn et al., 1994), family violence, family history of drug abuse, firearms in the home, and exposure to the suicidal behavior of others (National Insti- tute of Mental Health, 2012). Other search terms included common antidepressants, as well as phrases that indicated suicide (Hawton, Zahl, \& Weaterall, 2003), ideation (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2012a), deliberate self-harm (Zahl \& Hawton, 2004), bullying (Klomek, Sourander, \& Gould, 2011), feelings of isolation (CDC, 2012), and impulsiveness (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2012b). [Self-directed Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, report from Megan]

Before searching, we did some kinds of preprocess work:  (1) converted all text to lower case (2) stripped out all the punctuations and special characters; (3) built a slang dictionary which contains 5424 text slang based on online resources [http://www.noslang.com/dictionary/], Internet slang, and abbreviations. We replaced all the matching items fount in the dataset with corresponding easy read words. These two steps helped us extract more suicide-related tweets for analysis in the following process.


\subsection{Preprocess}
-stopwords
-keep stemming words

Using Scikit-learn package(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html\#citing-scikit-learn), it is very simple to remove stop words (like ``and'', ``the'', etc.) with parameter ``stop\_words'' tuned as ``string \{`english'\}''. 

At the same time, we kept original words without any word stemming, i.e.: ``computers'', ``computing'', and ``compute'', neither of these words will be mapped to the same stem ``comput''. The reason here is: a tweet containing like ``soooooooooo sad!" is supposed to convey stronger emotions than simple ``so sad''.

 
\subsection{Analysis}
-topic modeling

\subsection{features}
-unigram, bigram, trigram
-tf-idf
As features, we used unigram, bigram and trigram tokens in the whole training data as the attributes. For example, a simple tweet ``I am so depressed'' is represented as the following feature vector: \{I, am, so, depressed, I am, am so, so depressed, I am so, am so depressed\}. The tf-idf values were calculated for each attribute: tf-idf stands for ``term frequency - inverse document frequency'', which is a numerical statistic to reflect how important a tokenization is to a document in a collection or corpus. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a tokenization appears in the dataset, but is offset by the frequency of the tokenization in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words are generally more common than others. With the help of Scikit-learn package(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html\#citing-scikit-learn), there values can be easily acquired.
