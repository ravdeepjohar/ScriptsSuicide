63519045	26000346978	@keith_wilson PhD is on presentism. Working on some early literature (McTaggart and Prior) for background.
63519045	25998889593	Long weekend starts now. Off to Sheffield tomorrow.
63519045	25998860992	Productive day on McTaggart.
63519045	25970616099	@jonathantallant Glad you still like it. I'm enjoying summarising McT, but it is a little dense. I don't feel I'm making it any shorter.
63519045	25968713845	Slowly wading through McTaggart.
63519045	25965331340	@jichikawa That is excellent.
63519045	25925154693	Finished watching the third series of Mad Men. Brilliant TV.
63519045	25910512642	RT @AidanMcGlynn: Yablo's Analysis piece on paradoxes without self-reference really is a thing of beauty. I think that every time I see it.
63519045	25880529201	@andowjames No idea. No posters up, no email sent out and the website has the correct dates.
63519045	25870559973	Happy birthday @bthsmart!
63519045	25808543722	@jonathantallant Leave the puppies alone.
63519045	25795246313	@SDMumford I have met Sebastián. I will have to talk to him about presenting something in the Spring.
63519045	25792684166	Surprisingly productive few hours in the postgrad room. I need to spend more time there and more frequently.
63519045	25770870505	@andowjames Any other graduate students or is it just the wasps?
63519045	25768887075	@SDMumford It was a birthday present from a friend. It's one of her favourites as well.
63519045	25767246335	@jonathantallant Which paper? And where? Good luck!
63519045	25767226641	Finished reading 'Naive. Super' by @erlendloe. A really nice little book.
63519045	25687922947	I don't know what possessed me, when it is currently colder in the house than outside it, to walk around in shorts and a t-shirt.
63519045	25589096663	@Splend 'Pick up the gun... and the socks.'
63519045	25482105512	@jonathantallant Quite right. I feel so very foolish.
63519045	25446267089	@SDMumford Good luck getting home in good time.
63519045	25442631294	Handing in my dissertation in advance of the deadline has given me a long weekend off. I genuinely don't know what to do with myself.
63519045	25438927346	@jonathantallant I wasn't aware of the "R" rule for port. What excludes the summer months from port enjoyment?
63519045	25438878449	@carriejenkins There's nothing wrong with feeling like Liz Lemon.
63519045	25401313719	@andowjames Aesthetics and Ethics occupy 7/10. Next term might be different though. I should point out I have no complaints as organiser.
63519045	25401105475	@andowjames Disappointing. The balance is a little off without more metaphysics.
63519045	25399379232	Delighted Dr Charlotte Matheson will be presenting at the postgraduate seminar. Brings the total of metaphysicians presenting up to 2/10.
63519045	25399224425	@colincaret Sounds like a very logical lunch.
63519045	25386687849	@jonathantallant Forgot to ask yesterday. Any progress with the monograph?
63519045	25327666165	MA complete. Thinking about having a long weekend before getting back to work on the PhD.
63519045	25327581992	@laurenredhead It used to be 500 points per £2.50 voucher, but that might have changed.
63519045	25298746713	First PhD supervision scheduled. Going to tackle McTaggart. Quite looking forward to it, actually.
63519045	25294162210	I shouldn't be this confused after a 15-minute meeting.
63519045	25284209454	Saw The Other Guys at the cinema last night. Funnier than expected (and consistently funny throughout). Not perfect, but I would recommend.
63519045	25200223456	Registering as a PhD student today... I don't feel any different.
63519045	25106860360	@andowjames No. 6th October will be the first.
63519045	25103370805	@andowjames Indeed. Full credit to you. Catherine will be presenting on November 24th.
63519045	25103120096	Postgraduate research seminars at Nottingham this semester will have an interdisciplinary flavour. Thank you, @andowjames.
63519045	25098000584	Congratulations to @neerajmathad for passing his second FSA exam yesterday!
63519045	25038938768	Think, but don't think too much. http://bbc.in/cjfPRj
63519045	25038428689	Fresher's fair was the same as ever, but I've changed. Made me feel like a grumpy old git.
63519045	25038307102	@jonathantallant What?! Bastards!
63519045	24969478526	Always a funny time of year when students return. Something in the air. I start my fifth academic year in Nottingham this week. Scary.
63519045	24969333861	@Splend Good luck for tomorrow.
63519045	24954473666	@andowjames To be fair, 'funny' could refer to both humorous and peculiar.
63519045	24954192787	@andowjames I have tweeted an example where I laughed, but probably shouldn't.
63519045	24954139438	"No, you understand, you just don't agree." #funnyphilosophyquotes
63519045	24944639886	Putting together my presentation for the first postgraduate research seminar of the year.
63519045	24868532569	@Splend Off the top of my head... 'The NoteBook Antiqua' and 'The Constantia Gardner' #fontfilms.
63519045	24852987625	@andowjames True. My bad. I will assume that the Josh Greene reference threw me off.
63519045	24849608267	@andowjames Tell him to send me an email. I might have to run it past Philip, but it shouldn't be a problem.
63519045	24741948869	@jonathantallant I like PPR. Good quality papers and issues six times a year.
63519045	24696058882	Trying to do something with my dissertation this evening, but to no effect. Ended up reading comics. #sensible
63519045	24696020756	@neerajmathad Message received and understood. Hope exam stress eases fairly soon. (On the plus side, just think of the wage packet.)
63519045	24679041041	@AidanMcGlynn Congratulations!
63519045	24676503643	@jonathantallant Hopefully the opposite will also prove to be the case, just to compensate.
63519045	24647952671	@jonathantallant Keep it tasteful.
63519045	24646511327	@jonathantallant Are you still trying to bury maximalism?
63519045	24602065904	Thoroughly enjoyed today's #xphiukworkshop.
63519045	24554107469	Quite glad I didn't have to travel from Nottingham to Bristol today. Cheltenham to Bristol is orders of magnitude easier.
63519045	24553139593	@KomRomRom Philosophers are quite forgiving. I'm sure they'll allow you to get away with that.
63519045	24553095197	@ykdesigns That doesn't stop me...
63519045	24549805039	@andowjames Bah! Details, details.
63519045	24549570747	Today I journey to Bristol, as an X-phi novice, to attend @andowjames's #xphiukworkshop. Should be very interesting.
63519045	24461367385	Travelling today. Looking forward to the X-phi workshop tomorrow.
63519045	24456221498	RT @NanetteNielsen: Nottingham is named the least car-dependent City in England. (I certainly don’t need one!) :) http://tinyurl.com/333g7ew
63519045	24407424694	I love Penny Arcade. http://bit.ly/amHZjh
63519045	24379283492	Contemplating the suggestion by @jonathantallant that I read every sentence of my dissertation thoroughly and in isolation. Daunting.
63519045	24368169272	@andowjames (Eternalist's response) It's still here. -- I know which I find more intuitive.
63519045	24363022686	Where did the weekend go?
63519045	24309861510	@ykdesigns What are your post-GSK plans?
63519045	24290880164	@SDMumford What's the difference between a referee and an advisor?
63519045	24288991612	Remainder of today to be spent rewriting section 6 of my dissertation.
63519045	24288878378	@SDMumford Good news! Are these referee comments or other sources?
63519045	24282823205	Half-marathon completed by Beca in 1hr 47mins. Very impressed.
63519045	24266137150	Going to watch Beca run the Nottingham half-marathon today... I imagine I will get tired just watching them all warm up.
63519045	24103132227	Postgraduate research seminar programme is looking a little more healthy after cornering a few of my apathetic peers yesterday. Good news.
63519045	24052725848	Today I discovered that I do not have an innate ability to mark exam scripts. This was disappointing.
63519045	23937891041	Back from conference work for the last time. Microbiology and I will now part ways.
63519045	23270414488	Brain turning to mush. I blame the two day barrage of microbiology papers.
63519045	23166123425	10 hours spent working at a conference today. Same again tomorrow. 12 hours on Wednesday. Good for money, bad for sleep.
63519045	23118048618	What a horrible hour.
63519045	23086420755	Not looking forward to getting up at 6am for work tomorrow, but I do need the money. Might be quite fun work though, we shall see.
63519045	23086388168	@SDMumford What are you working on at the moment?
63519045	23068753352	Can't help but feel I've wasted the day.
63519045	23061947003	@colincaret Hilarious. Good find.
63519045	22984239462	Sainsbury's on a Saturday afternoon. Hell itself.
63519045	22962659348	Not enough shelf space. Disaster. Part of today must be devoted to office organisation.
63519045	22962596382	@SDMumford You must! Try and get a special edition. The audio commentary by the band is worth whatever extra you would pay.
63519045	22901788727	Back in Beeston again.
63519045	22893125371	Surprised to discover my girlfriend is a 'cover girl': http://bit.ly/aRSXYh
63519045	22825996299	My philosophy (mini-)library has increased a little in size since my birthday... I am a huge geek.
63519045	22807709244	Drowning in 'Out of Office' replies.
63519045	22800102076	It's difficult to combat other people's apathy.
63519045	22744804324	@SDMumford I certainly hope so. Some people credit him with being a heroic plagiarist, but I've never seen much evidence to back that up.
63519045	22744165151	@SDMumford Considering how many words Shakespeare invented, he was hardly constrained by the number of words that existed.
63519045	22718129308	@andowjames Lured further away from campus by the delights of Beeston, obviously.
63519045	22718041276	@carriejenkins Always cut off a finger to save a hand. #goodchairing
63519045	22709469084	@andowjames To where are you moving?
63519045	22645887501	Excited by the prospect of teaching next semester. A few obstacles to overcome first though.
63519045	22643657390	Jimmy Fallon, Jon Hamm, Tina Fey and the Glee cast singing 'Born to Run'? Awesome.
63519045	22640970830	I know more about Sartre's views on human freedom now than I did a few days ago. Not sure if this is a good thing.
63519045	22595006643	@andowjames Thanks. Hoping to stay on top of it so that I don't get panicked at all. (Unlikely.)
63519045	22561634456	@andowjames Due end of September.
63519045	22550720738	Packing. Off home tomorrow for a few days. Leaving dissertation related woes behind.
63519045	22532189176	@carriejenkins So far #because2 has looked like a fantastic conference. Quite jealous.
63519045	22513796023	@carriejenkins Good news!
63519045	22513634786	Important section to write today. Hoping to finish it by this evening.
63519045	22513601964	@carriejenkins Future colleague?
63519045	22463767344	The Victoria in Beeston is fast becoming a favourite spot. A shame it's so far out of the way, but it is worth the journey.
63519045	22344358891	Cooking a Sunday roast on a Saturday. I'm a maverick.
63519045	22295782941	@carlbaker Congratulations! I look forward to reading it!
63519045	22256004891	Thanks for the birthday wishes! @bthsmart @carriejenkins @jonathantallant @Splend
63519045	22164025055	@laurenredhead Doing the PhD at Nottingham with @jonathantallant and Philip Percival.
63519045	22160761929	@laurenredhead The topic, broadly, is presentism--the thesis that only present objects exist--in the philosophy of time.
63519045	22126492595	Hoping for good dissertation day tomorrow, then giving myself a few days off.
63519045	22126444413	Another excellent episode of The Wire watched tonight. Loving getting back into these and introducing them to someone new.
63519045	22125911842	@laurenredhead Dissertation deadline at the end of September, PhD starts at the beginning of October.
63519045	22119704718	I am feeling more and more that I want to stop writing my dissertation and move on to more interesting things. PhD can't start soon enough.
63519045	22075719002	@jonathantallant How was the school visit?
63519045	22002734377	Library session drawing to a close.
63519045	21986481429	Today I begin the final chapter of my MA dissertation. Hoping for a productive day.
63519045	21955208463	Heavy dissertation day today. Enjoyed getting back into things. Looking forward to a session in the library tomorrow too.
63519045	21743324584	@carriejenkins *facepalm*
63519045	21690435527	Andy Murray beaten by someone called 'Mardy Fish'. Great name.
63519045	21675068550	@Splend Try and round off that marathon with a back-to-back session of 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Has to be done.
63519045	21674593059	Almost finished for the day.
63519045	21674539905	@neerajmathad Make sure your future-self elaborates on craziness in the forthcoming email.
63519045	21674511301	@laurenredhead On the plus side, Somerset did beat Essex. So, that's something to keep in mind.
63519045	21657614542	Posted by a friend on facebook yesterday: 'It's sexy A-levels!' http://sexyalevels.tumblr.com/
63519045	21656486823	#ff @laurenredhead for offering #ff advice. (See, that was simple.)
63519045	21656453061	@andowjames @laurenredhead You're right! I completely forgot. Obviously I don't mind offending people for the greater good.
63519045	21655383355	@laurenredhead I've never done a #ff. I feel as though I should but I don't want to leave anyone out.
63519045	21653824697	Really looking forward to getting back to work on my dissertation next week. Hoping to crack my issues with the modal-temporal analogy.
63519045	21650802266	Superb performance by Trescothick yesterday -- http://bbc.in/9uE5cY
63519045	21648850256	A lot less hectic than yesterday morning. A lot fewer depressing calls as well. Hurrah!
63519045	21613542546	Another day working on admissions tomorrow. End of business today was very quiet, so not sure what tomorrow will be like at all.
63519045	21594768882	@jonathantallant Congratulations!
63519045	21591070427	Trescothick has thumped 224 from 225 balls so far today. Fantastic.
63519045	21588902187	@Splend Very briefly, I wondered what 'Finnish clothes-washing' was... It's already been a long day.
63519045	21580149712	@andowjames I am. With sporadic and limited internet.
63519045	21574621142	This work is also a lot more depressing than I first thought. Telling people they haven't got a place at University is horrible.
63519045	21553826321	I take some small comfort from the fact that work starts a little later tomorrow. This hour is distinctly unpleasant.
63519045	21512425716	@SDMumford Great title! Looking forward to that.
63519045	21512404149	@jonathantallant It's the Castle Rock tap. Lots of good beer. It's on the outskirts of the city centre, near the station.
63519045	21512014065	@SDMumford Can't imagine why you'd be interested in that book...
63519045	21511969023	@jonathantallant Have you been to the Vat & Fiddle yet? Worth a trip if you fancy an evening of many different quality ales.
63519045	21507005731	Admissions hotline work tomorrow seems a lot more hectic than I had initially thought. That being said, I need the money.
63519045	21506935423	@jonathantallant What are you drinking?

63519045	21440565815	Trying to decide whether I should, as organiser, give a paper at the first postgraduate seminar of the year. I will have to sleep on it.
